# Remote Patient Monitoring System

A brief description of what this project is, we propose an architecture for healthcare monitoring that addresses the privacy and security issues inherent in systems integrated with IoT. By leveraging the use of blockchain and smart algorithms within a cognitive systems framework, we aim to streamline management processes and enhance self-organization capabilities. Case studies, including the application of the proposed architecture in combating COVID-19, are presented to illustrate its potential impact and efficiancy.

## FAQ

#### What is Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)?

RPM is a healthcare program that allows providers to monitor patientsâ€™ health outside of conventional healthcare settings, such as hospitals or clinics. It involves using digital technology to collect medical and other health information from patients and securely send it to healthcare practitioners.

#### How does Remote Patient Monitoring work?

RPM involves the use of medical devices and sensors to collect health data, including blood pressure, heart rate, and blood glucose levels. Patients can use these devices on their own and record their vitals. The health data is securely transferred to healthcare practitioners who examine it and make required interventions.

#### What are the benefits of an RPM program?

- Increased convenience for both patients and providers
- Early detection of health issues
- Improved patient engagement
- Reduced hospitalizations and readmissions
